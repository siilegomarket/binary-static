The Company is always the final counterparty to the client&#x27;s Transactions. The Company may execute Orders on behalf of its client, wherein the Company will act as a broker and pass on the Order to the liquidity provider for execution. Alternatively, the Company may also keep the client&#x27;s Order on its own account, wherein the Company will take the other side of the client&#x27;s trade. It is further noted that the Company may make a profit as a result of the client&#x27;s losses and vice-versa. Further details can be found under Conflicts of interest policy and Order execution policy.</p><p>The provision of the trading services described in this agreement utilises a third-party system acquired via a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sub-licensable, terminable licence from the third-party system provider/licensor (the &quot;MT5 trading platform&quot;). The client acknowledges that, when providing trading services described in this agreement to the client, BIEL may decide to change its third–party system provider/licensor and use a trading platform other than the MT5 trading platform. Hence, in such cases, BIEL may decide to use an entirely new third–party system provider/licensor (hereinafter referred to as the &quot;new trading platform&quot;) or to introduce an additional third–party system provider/licensor (hereinafter referred to as the &quot;additional trading platform&quot;).</p><p>If BIEL decides to introduce a new trading platform, it shall provide the client with a relevant notice within 30 days before it introduces the new trading platform or the additional trading platform. In such a notice, BIEL will outline information including, but not limited to, features and operations of the new trading platform. Thus, using its backup database on the MT5 trading platform, BIEL shall integrate all data to the new trading platform, including but not limited to open trades, historical trades/data, and accounts.</p><h2 data-anchor="account-management">Account management</h2><ol><li><strong>Opening an MT5 Real Account</strong><p>To be able to trade OTC instruments available on the MT5 trading platform, the client has to first</p><ol><li>Open a Binary.com account through BIEL&#x27;s website <a href="/ko/new-account.html" target="_blank">www.binary.com</a></li><li><p>a.

If the client chooses to trade FX and CFDs, the client shall transfer funds from their Binary.com account to their MT5 Real Account. Such a transfer shall not be regarded as a transfer from two different accounts but as a transfer of funds from the client&#x27;s centralised Binary.com account to the MT5 Real Account. No fund transfers shall be made to any other account in the name of any third party.</p><p>The client agrees to comply with the following when making payments to BIEL:</p><ol><li>Deposits and/or payments due are to be made in the currency chosen by the client from the ones specified by BIEL from time to time.</li><li>The client is responsible for all third-party electronic transfer fees in respect of payments.</li><li>Payments made to BIEL will only be deemed to have been received once BIEL receives cleared funds.</li><li>The client bears the responsibility of ensuring that payments made to BIEL are correctly received with the specified client&#x27;s account details.</li></ol><p>There are no charges for transferring money from the client&#x27;s Binary.com account to their MT5 Real Account.</p></li><li>Transfer of funds from the MT5 Real Account<p>If the client has a positive balance in their MT5 Real Account, they may transfer such balance from their MT5 Real Account into their Binary.com account and then request a withdrawal as necessary for any amount available on their Binary.com account. The Company may withhold, deduct, or refuse to make any such transfer or withdrawal, in whole or in part, if</p><ol><li>The client has Open Positions on the account that show a loss.</li><li>Such a transfer would result in the client&#x27;s Account Equity dropping to less than zero.</li><li>The requested transfer would reduce the client&#x27;s Account Balance to less than the Margin required for the client&#x27;s Open Positions.</li><li>The Company reasonably considers that funds may be required to meet any current or future Margin Requirements on Open Positions due to the underlying market conditions.</li><li>The Company reasonably determines that there is an unresolved dispute between the Company and the client relating to the agreed terms and conditions.</li><li>There is an amount outstanding from the client to BIEL.</li><li>BIEL is required to do so in accordance with any relevant law or regulation.</li></ol><p>The client&#x27;s MT5 Real Account as well as all payments and withdrawals therefrom must be made in the same currency as maintained in the client&#x27;s Binary.com account.</p></li><li>마이너스 잔고 보호<p>When using the MT5 trading platform, all BIEL&#x27;s clients will be provided with Margin monitoring functionality to protect the clients from encountering negative balances when trading under normal market conditions. As a trader, the client should always maintain the appropriate levels of Margin in their trading account as the recommended method of their own risk management.</p><p>If the client&#x27;s usable Margin drops below 100%, a Margin Call mode will be triggered and maintained till the level of 50%. In the event that the client&#x27;s Margin Level is equal to, or drops below 50%, the Company will initiate the closing of the client&#x27;s current Open Positions, starting from the most unprofitable, until the required Margin Level is achieved. In such events, the positions will be automatically closed at the current market price at that point in time.</p><p>In exceptional circumstances, where there is a price change in the underlying that is sufficiently large and sudden, gapping can occur. In such cases, the automatic Margin close-out protection might fail, causing the client&#x27;s Account Balance to fall below zero. For this purpose, a Negative Balance Protection mechanism has been introduced. Negative Balance Protection provides a &#x27;backstop&#x27; in case of extreme market conditions and ensures that the client&#x27;s maximum losses from trading CFDs, including all related costs, are limited to the balance available on the client&#x27;s CFD account. Therefore, the client can never lose more money than the total sum invested for trading CFDs; if the client&#x27;s CFD account balance falls below zero, the Company will compensate the negative balance as soon as possible without any additional cost to the client.</p><p>Negative Balance Protection does not apply to the clients categorised as Professional Traders, who can still lose more money than their available balance.</p></li></ol></li><li><strong>계좌 해지</strong><p>If the client wishes to withdraw funds from their MT5 Real Account and/or close their MT5 Real Account, the client may notify the Company by contacting the helpdesk at <a href="mailto:support@binary.com">support@binary.com</a>.

Reasons for differences in feed providers include:</p><ul><li>For forex: The forex market is an OTC (over the counter) market, where banks and other major financial institutions trade currencies amongst themselves without there being any central clearing house. Accordingly, there is no &#x27;official&#x27; price source for forex quotes. Different data feeds will contain quotes from a different sub-set of international banks. Accordingly, prices may differ among providers, depending on which bank(s) they obtain prices from.</li><li>Market-closing times: The client is asked to refer to <a href="/ko/resources/market_timesws.html">Trading times</a> page for the exact time of settlement for all contracts. Other websites may adopt a different convention (for example, some websites choose 4 o&#x27;clock NY time or 5 o&#x27;clock London time). As a result, the open, high, low, and closing prices displayed on the Company&#x27;s website may differ from those on other websites, due to the market-closing time convention.</li><li>Use of bid/ask prices: When the market is illiquid, the data feed may contain many bid and ask prices, without there actually being any traded price for quite a while. By taking an average of the bid/ask price (i.e. bid + ask, divided by 2), a market quote is generated that reflects the current market, without it actually being a traded price. The Company&#x27;s system will generate prices from these bid and ask prices, whereas other websites might not. As a result, the Company&#x27;s website might display ticks that do not appear in the data feeds of other websites.</li></ul><p>본 회사의 데이터 피드는 거래환경에 있어 가장 탄탄하며 최고의 수준으로 디자인되었습니다.</p><h2 data-anchor="weekend-quotes">주말 견적</h2><p>The client is asked to note that weekend quotes are ignored for the purpose of contract settlement. During weekends, the forex markets may occasionally generate prices; however, these prices are often artificial (traders sometimes take advantage of the illiquidity of the markets during weekends to push prices up or down). To avoid settling prices based on such artificial prices, it is Company&#x27;s policy not to count weekend prices towards contract settlement values (except for Volatility Indices, which are open during weekends).</p></div></div><div id="privacy-content" class="toggle-content invisible"><div><h2 data-anchor="security-and-privacy">보안 및 개인정보 보호</h2><p>본 회사는 고객의 개인정보와 금융정보 보호에 대한 중요성을 인지하고 있습니다.</p><p>All the information that the Company obtains about the client assists the Company in servicing the client and the client&#x27;s account.

These regulatory measures place obligations on users of personal data like the Company. They also lay down the principles for fair and lawful processing of all the information that the Company acquires.</p><p>It is the Company&#x27;s commitment to safeguard the client&#x27;s privacy online at all times. The Company only uses the client&#x27;s personal information to help the Company service the client&#x27;s account, to improve the Company&#x27;s services to the client, and to provide the client with products that the client has requested. The Company does not sell the client&#x27;s personal information to third parties, but the Company may provide it to payment providers to facilitate transactions on the client&#x27;s account.</p><p>The client&#x27;s personal information is used primarily as a way of validating the client as the legitimate account owner and proper recipient of withdrawal payments. The Company also uses this information to process the client&#x27;s trades. The Company collects from the client all personal and financial data directly relating to the client when the client fills in the Company&#x27;s account opening form. In all instances, the client has either a legal or a contractual obligation to provide the Company with the information. If such information is not provided, the Company will be unable to provide the client with its services.</p><p>The Company reserves the right to request further information from the client whenever deemed appropriate under the circumstances. For example, the Company may ask the client to send the Company additional acceptable documents to confirm the authenticity of the client&#x27;s account details or of any withdrawal request.</p><p>The Company holds all the personal data that the Company collects from the client with due diligence and only processes them for purposes as required or allowed by law. This includes the process of obtaining and sharing of certain information with third parties for credit or identity checks to comply with legal and regulatory obligations. In certain cases, the Company may process the client&#x27;s data to fulfill the Company&#x27;s contractual obligations with the client.</p><p>The Company also collects basic tax residence information for the purposes of CRS/FATCA compliance. The tax information that the client provides may only be disclosed to the authorities who are legally charged with collecting this information for CRS/FATCA reporting, and Binary.com will only do so to the extent that is legally obliged to collect it from the clients and disclose it to the authorities. The Company does not use, disclose, or process this information in any other way at any time.</p><p>The client may update the client&#x27;s personal information at any time by logging in to the &quot;Settings&quot; section of the client&#x27;s account. It is the client&#x27;s responsibility to ensure that Binary.com is promptly and continually informed of any change in the client&#x27;s personal information. The client should note that if the client provides the Company with inaccurate information, or if the client fails to notify the Company of any changes to the information previously supplied by the client, this may adversely affect the quality of the services that the Company can provide.</p><h2 data-anchor="profiling-and-categorisation">프로파일링 및 분류</h2><p>The Company collects and assesses the client&#x27;s data to profile the client in relation to the Company&#x27;s products.

This is the reason why the Company cannot retrieve the client&#x27;s password and has to issue the client with a new one, sent to the client&#x27;s email address, if the client cannot recall it.</li><li>The Company maintains customer balances in cash or cash equivalent.

Such independence-upholding procedures can be followed, for example, through the operation of information barriers, physical separation of staff, the segregation of duties and responsibilities, and the maintenance of a policy of independence, which requires the Company&#x27;s staff, when providing services to a client, to act in the best interests of the client and to disregard any conflicts of interest, or in some circumstances, to decline to act for a client or potential client in order to avoid conflicts of interest.</p><h2 data-anchor="disclosure-general">Disclosure (General)</h2><p>The organisational and administrative arrangements established by the Company to prevent or manage a conflict are not sufficient to ensure, with reasonable confidence, that the risk of damage to the interest of the client will be prevented.

Binary Options can have only one of two possible outcomes and allow the client to take a simple &quot;Yes or No&quot; approach. Like traditional options, Binary Options are based on an underlying asset such as currencies, commodities, or indices; however, one of the most significant differences between Binary Options and traditional options, among others, is that there can only be two outcomes for the option, either the client is paid the return upon the occurrence of the event, or the client loses the investment amount as determined in each option.</p><p>Trading in Binary Options is speculative and involves a high degree of risk that can result in the loss of the client&#x27;s entire investment. Therefore, trading in Binary Options is appropriate only for persons that understand and are willing to assume the economic, legal, and other risks involved in such transactions. The client should be satisfied that Binary Options trading is suitable for the client in light of the client&#x27;s investment circumstances and attitude towards risk before trading. The client should not engage in speculative Binary Options trading unless the client understands the basic aspects of such trading and its risks. If the client is in any doubt as to whether Binary Option trading is appropriate and suitable for the client, the client should seek independent advice from an investment consulting professional. Binary.com does not provide such advice. It is the client&#x27;s responsibility, taking into account the client&#x27;s personal circumstances and investment resources, to take particular care and make careful considerations independently, both prior to applying to engage in Binary Options with Binary.com and prior to making any individual order. Where the client does not understand the risks involved in applying for a trading account with Binary.com or in making any individual order, the client should seek advice and consultation from an independent investment advisor. If the client continues to not understand the risks involved in trading in Binary Options, the client should not trade at all.</p><p>The client is advised that the Binary Options offered by Binary.com are not traded under the rules of any recognised, designated, or regulated exchange. Consequently, engaging in Binary Options trading may expose the client to substantially greater risks than the investments that are so traded.</p><p>고객께서는 다음의 추가적인 위험들에 대하여 경고 받았습니다:</p><p>Derivative investment instruments such as Binary Options and related markets can be highly volatile.

If the client deposits funds in a currency to trade contracts denominated in a different currency, the client&#x27;s gains or losses on the underlying investment may be affected by changes in the exchange rate between the currencies.</p><p>Other Risks: There are other risks related to trading Investment Products and foreign currencies that cannot be described in detail in this document. Generally, however, securities, options, and currency transactions involve exposure to a combination of the following risk factors: market risk, credit risk, settlement risk, liquidity risk, operational risk, and legal risk. For example, there can be serious market disruptions if local or overseas economic, political, or other unforeseen events affect the market. In addition to these types of risk, there may be other factors such as accounting and tax treatment issues that the client should consider.</p><h2 data-anchor="market-opinions">시장 의견</h2><p>All opinions, news, research, analysis, prices, or other information contained on this website are provided as general market commentary and do not constitute investment advice.

Its objective is rather to provide the client with information, so that the client can reasonably understand the risks associated with forex and contracts for differences offered by Binary.com, as it is the Company&#x27;s intention to provide the client with the best possible trading experience.</p><h2 data-anchor="forex-and-cfd-high-risk">외환과 차액거래는 높은 위험이 따르며 투기적입니다</h2><p>Forex and contract for differences transactions involve a high degree of risk and are speculative because they allow the client to speculate on the short-term price movements of the underlying financial instruments. The client should not enter into forex and/or contract-for-difference transactions unless the client is able to sustain losses that exceed the client&#x27;s deposited funds. It is important for the client to understand that in order to realise any value from the client&#x27;s open positions, the client would have to enter into a corresponding transaction to close the client&#x27;s open positions and may find it difficult or impossible to do so under certain market conditions.</p><h2 data-anchor="execution-model">실행 모델 및 거래상대방에 관한 위험</h2><p>Binary.com offers forex and contracts for differences via a series of models - either solely dealing on own account (dealing desk), or wholly hedging client orders with the Company&#x27;s liquidity providers (no-dealing desk), or a hybrid model, depending on the Company with which the client has a contract. For the hybrid model, client orders are typically hedged when the total transaction volume exceeds a predefined threshold of risk tolerance level. For these execution models, Binary.com acts as the contractual counterparty to the transactions that the client enters into with the Company, as opposed to entering into a contractual counterparty with a central clearing house as would be the case with exchange-traded financial instruments. As such, counterparty risk exists. Counterparty risk refers to the risk of loss for clients resulting from the fact that the counterparty to the forex and/or contract-for-difference transaction that the client has entered into may default on its obligations prior to the final settlement of the transaction&#x27;s cash flow.</p><h2 data-anchor="leverage">레버리지</h2><p>Leverage, in the context of margin trading, refers to the use of margin to increase/amplify the value of a trade. Leverage is expressed as a ratio. A 50:1 leverage, for example, means that the client would be able to enter into a trade position that is of 50 times higher than the client&#x27;s margin. When the client invests in a leveraged product, the client&#x27;s profit or loss is based on the leveraged position, i.e. the increased/amplified value of the client&#x27;s trade is determined based on the leverage ratio that the client has set for the client&#x27;s account.</p><p>Leverage can be used to generate returns that are of multiple times higher than the amount set aside from the client&#x27;s account balance to open and maintain a transaction (the client&#x27;s margin). However, investments that have the potential to deliver greater investment returns carry higher levels of risk. This means that if the price movement is against the client&#x27;s favour, the client will suffer losses that are multiple times higher than the amount set aside from the client&#x27;s account balance to open and maintain a transaction (the client&#x27;s margin).</p><h2 data-anchor="relationship-between-margin-and-leverage">Relationship between margin and leverage</h2><p>The leverage ratio refers to the number of times that the client&#x27;s margin (the amount set aside from the client&#x27;s account balance to open and maintain a transaction) can be &quot;leveraged&quot; to enter into a transaction. The denominator of the leverage ratio is always one. A 50:1 leverage is equivalent to a 2% margin requirement (1 divided by 50 = 2%). The leverage ratio that the Company/the client establishes will determine the amount of margin required. As leverage is inversely proportional to margin, as the leverage that the client sets for the client&#x27;s account gets lower, the margin required to be set aside from the client&#x27;s account balance (the client&#x27;s margin requirement) gets higher.</p><h2 data-anchor="risk-of-stop-order">Risk of stop order</h2><p>The system fills orders on a first-in, first-out basis, i.e. based on the sequence of the order received, and this is beyond the Company&#x27;s control. As a result, the client may find it difficult or impossible to close a position at the intended price stipulated in the client&#x27;s stop order during certain market conditions. The placement of stop order by the client, though useful as a risk management tool, will not necessarily limit the client&#x27;s losses to the client&#x27;s intended amounts in the event of highly volatile trading conditions, since market conditions may make it impossible to execute such orders, and there is uncertainty about the client&#x27;s possible exit price. In short, a stop order is not guaranteed because it cannot operate in all market circumstances.</p><h2 data-anchor="regular-monitoring">오픈 포지션의 정기적인 모니터링</h2><p>Trading forex and contracts for differences carries a high level of risk and Binary.com does not monitor the open positions of the client&#x27;s account on the client&#x27;s behalf. It is the client&#x27;s responsibility to monitor the client&#x27;s open positions and understand the exposure of the client&#x27;s open positions whilst ensuring that the client&#x27;s exposure commensurate with the client&#x27;s risk appetite. Due to the cost associated with overnight open positions, the client should consider investing in the market of the instrument in which the client ordinarily transacts instead of investing in a CFD.</p><h2 data-anchor="risk-of-slippage">슬리피지의 위험</h2><p>Whilst the Company endeavours to open or close the transaction to which the client&#x27;s orders relate at the requested price, acting in accordance with the Company&#x27;s duty of best execution, there are times when, due to an increase in volatility or volume, orders may be subject to slippage. The difference between the order price and execution price when orders are filled is known as slippage. This means that the client&#x27;s order is not filled at the exact intended quoted price when the client places their order. Slippage is usually seen during periods of extremely high or low volatility and generally occurs during fundamental news releases or periods of limited liquidity. Slippages can result in either a positive slippage (more favourable to the client) or a negative slippage (less favourable to the client).</p><h2 data-anchor="external-forces">외력</h2><p>The client&#x27;s forex and contract-for-difference transactions with Binary.com are linked to an underlying financial instrument, and the client will be exposed to price, currency exchange, interest rate, or other volatility of the market to which the client&#x27;s financial instrument is related to, especially if the market is of a jurisdiction that is foreign to the client. Forex and contract-for-difference trading over the Internet via an electronic trading platform is subject to data latency risk, which may result in delays in order execution.</p></div></div><div id="order-execution-binary-content" class="toggle-content invisible"><div><h2 data-anchor="summary-order-execution-policy">주문 실행 정책 개요</h2><p>The Company has a general duty to conduct its business with the client honestly, fairly, and professionally and to act in the client&#x27;s best interests when opening and closing Binary Options trades with the client.</p><p>More specifically, when the Company enters into a Binary Option trade with the client (each, a &quot;Contract&quot;), the Company has a duty to provide the client with &#x27;best execution&#x27;.
