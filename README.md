How to work with this project
=============================

### Deploy to your gh-pages for the first time

1. Register your application [here](https://developers.binary.com/applications/). This will give you the ability to redirect back to your github pages after login.
Use `https://YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME.github.io/binary-static/en/logged_inws.html` for the Redirect URL and `https://YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME.github.io/binary-static/en/redirect.html` for the Verification URL.

    If you're using a custom domain, replace the github URLs above with your domain.

2. In `src/javascript/config.js`: Insert the `Application ID` of your registered application in `user_app_id`.
  * **NOTE:** In order to avoid accidentally committing personal changes to this file, use `git update-index --assume-unchanged src/javascript/config.js`

3. Run `grunt dev`


### Deploy js/css and template changes together

```
grunt dev
```


### Deploy only js/css changes

```
grunt deploy
```


### Deploy some template changes

```
grunt dev --path=about-us
```


### Using sub-folders
There are times that you are working on various branches at the same time, and you want to deploy/test each branch separately on your gh-pages, you can simply use `--branch=branchname` for grunt commands:
- `grunt dev --branch=branchname`
This will deploy your changes to a sub-folder named: `br_branchname` and it can be browsed at: https://YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME.github.io/binary-static/br_branchname/

In order to remove the created folders from your gh-pages, you can use either:
- `grunt dev --cleanup`: removes all `br_*` folders and deploys to the root folder.

  or
- `grunt shell:remove_folder --folder=br_branchname1,br_branchname2,...`: only removes the specified folder(s) from your gh-pages.

  or
- `grunt shell:remove_folder --keep --folder=br_branchname1,br_branchname2,...`: only keeps the specified folder(s) on your gh-pages and removes everything else. Just add the `--keep` flag.

### Preview on your local machine
- To preview your changes locally, run `sudo grunt serve`
- It will watch for js/css changes and rebuild on every change you make.
- To test changes made to templates, you need to re-compile them:
  - `grunt shell:compile_dev` to re-compile all templates.
  - `grunt shell:compile_dev --path=about-us` to re-compile only template(s) which serve about-us path in URL.
- To fix eslint errors run `npm run eslint`

## Release

```
grunt release --{release type}=1 [--cleanup] [--reset]
```
(The value is needed when more than one option is used)
